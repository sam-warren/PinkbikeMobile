# Welcome to Pinkbike Mobile.

This project was slapped together using React Native and Expo over the course of a few days out of sheer boredom. To run this project on your Android or iOS device, you will need: 
- Expo downloaded on your mobile device
- Yarn installed on your PC or Mac

After that, follow these instructions to run the app...

1. Clone this repository into your favourite directory.
2. In a new command window, navigate to the folder created when you cloned the app
3. Run `yarn` to install dependencies then `yarn run buildAndStart` to start the app.
3. Wait for Expo to spit out a QR code in the command line. 
 - If you have an Android device, scan that using the Expo app on your phone. The app will open.
 - If you have an iOS device, look for the address where the app is being hosted. It will look something like "exp://192.168.XX.XXX:19000". Paste this address in a new Safari window. As long as you have the Expo app installed on your iOS device, it should prompt you to "Open with Expo". The app will open.

This app is a work in progress! If you want to make any changes, PRs are welcome!
For any questions about the app send me an email at samwarren4@gmail.com.
